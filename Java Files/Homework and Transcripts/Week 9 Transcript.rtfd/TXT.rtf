\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 No, we're not going back to graphical programs. An \cf4 interface\cf0  is a special type of abstract class. It's basically a class that is 
\i entirely
\i0  abstract.

\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:32:59 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 Let's back up a bit. Sometimes, it would be beneficial for a class to have two superclasses. For example, consider a board game. Clearly, a board game is a type of game. It has rules, players, and a goal. So we could have a BoardGame class that inherits from a Game class.
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf2 dkneezel
\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:33:17 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 But a board game is also a product that is sold in a store. It has a price, a weight, a seller, and a resale value, potentially. So we might also like it if BoardGame inherited from Product.
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf2 dkneezel
\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:33:40 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 Note that Game and Product are very different things. Baseball is a game, but not a product. A laptop is a product, but not a game. So we can't make one a subclass of the other.

\b \cf0 When a class has more than one superclass, we have what is known as \cf4 multiple inheritance\cf0 . Both Python and C++ have mechanisms to allow it. However, Java does not. Can you think why?

\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:35:11 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 Yeah. These all touch on the main idea. The problem is that there could be conflicts in what gets inherited. Suppose Game and Product both have a toString method. Which one would BoardGame have? The first one defined? Both of them? And how would you refer to them? super only gets you to one superclass.
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf2 dkneezel
\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:35:32 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 Also if there are instance variables with the same name in the two superclasses, which of them does the subclass get?

\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf2 dkneezel
\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:35:43 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 C++ and Python have rules for all of this, but Java simplifies things by only allowing you to extend one superclass.
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf2 dkneezel
\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:35:51 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 It would be really nice to allow a BoardGame object, though, to be placed in both an ArrayList of Games and an ArrayList of Products. Fortunately, Java has a compromise solution.
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf2 dkneezel
\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:36:01 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 Remember one of the problems with multiple inheritance is what happens if there is code in both superclasses for the same method. But if one of the superclasses has it as an 
\i abstract
\i0  method, then there is no code in the method. No code, no conflict.
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf2 dkneezel
\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:36:22 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 To be safe, we have to ensure that none of the methods in one of the two superclasses has any code. So we can have multiple inheritance if one of the classes has entirely abstract methods. And it can't have any instance variables, since those might potentially cause a conflict as well. We call such a class an \cf4 interface\cf0 .
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf2 dkneezel
\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:36:42 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 So, for our BoardGame example, we can define a class called Game just like we do normally. BoardGame will extend Game to get all the Game methods and instance variables.
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf2 dkneezel
\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:36:53 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 Then we could also define an interface called Product. It would consist of a bunch of abstract methods like getPrice, setPrice, sell, returnToStore, etc. We would then have BoardGame \cf4 implement\cf0  this interface. The BoardGame class would have code for each of the abstract methods in Product.
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf2 dkneezel
\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:37:15 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 We can use a BoardGame object in a Game variable. We can call Game methods since BoardGame is a subclass. And we can use a BoardGame object in a Product variable, since we know BoardGame implements all the needed methods for a Product.

\b \cf0 So here's another approach. We write code to \cf4 catch\cf0  the generated exception. This will use a new Java structure called try-catch.

\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf2 dkneezel
\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 8:19:17 pm

\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 The structure has, as the name implies, two parts. In the first part, called the try block, we include the code that might cause the exception and any code relying on the exception-causing code to work.

\b \cf0 In the catch block, we give the code to execute when the exception happens. As soon as an exception is generated in the try block, Java jumps out of the try block and goes straight to the corresponding catch block.

\b \cf0 This is one of Java's more annoying issues. The issue is that scan.nextInt() does not remove bad input from consideration. So if I enter, say, X, causing an exception, the X remains to be processed by the Scanner.

\b \cf0 Here's the series of steps that happens in that unfortunate loop so we can see better what's going on. Java prompts for the numerator. We enter a bad value. That causes the exception with the error message in the catch block. Java goes back to the top of the while loop. goAgain is still true, so we repeat. Java prompts again.

\b \cf0 The problem is that since the bad value is still in the Scanner, scan.nextInt() tries to process that bad value a second time. It's still not an integer, so the exception occurs again. We get the error message, repeat the loop, and re-prompt. It's a vicious cycle.

\b \cf0 A \cf4 file\cf0  is a collection of related data stored on a disk. Java has the ability to read different kinds of files. We're going to focus today on the most common version -- the text file.\
We'll do this in the context of reading a set of grades stored in a file and determining their average. Go to the course home page and download the code in AverageFinder.java. It's basically code we've seen before to compute the average of a set of numbers in an array. For now, I assign the array values directly in the code. We'll switch it so the input comes from a file instead.

\b \cf0 First, we'll create a file outside of Java that our program could then read. You could do that in your favorite text editor like Notepad in Windows. You could use Microsoft Word or another fancy word processor, but be careful to save your work as a text file. Word has lots of hidden characters that it adds in invisibly; they would mess up your Java programs.

\b \cf0 Another choice would be to just make the text file you need using Eclipse. Go to File, then New. Choose the option for "File" about two-thirds down the menu. You'll get a window asking you to choose the parent folder. Choose the one for the project where the average code we've been working on is. Then in the "File name:" box, enter grades.txt and then click Finish.

\b \cf0 Make sure the cursor is right after the last number in the file. You don't want additional spaces or lines in the file. (We could write code to make our program more robust against such unexpected extra stuff, but I don't want to spend time on that tangent right now. Let's just keep things simple.) Then save the file -- the third icon under the menus is an old-time floppy disk. Click it to save. You should notice the star in the filename in the tab disappear when you do. Java will save your 
\i code
\i0  for you when you re-compile and run the program, but it won't do the same for your data.

\b \cf0 The explanation is a little complex. There are actually two kinds of exceptions in Java: \cf4 unchecked\cf0  and \cf4 checked\cf0 . An unchecked exception is one that a Java program does not have to deal with. When they occur, we don't need a try-catch block to handle them. If there's no block, then the exception is passed along to the caller. If the caller doesn't handle it, the exception goes to \cf4 its\cf0  caller, and so forth. Eventually the exception reaches main, and if main doesn't deal with it, the program crashes with lots of red lines.

\b \cf0 All the exceptions we've seen so far are unchecked. Checked exceptions require explicit code to tell Java what to do when they occur. Exceptions we make as subclasses of Exception are checked. Other examples include those that deal with file input and output that we saw earlier.

\b \cf0 We could solve the red lines here by putting a try-catch block in getAverage instead; that would take care of the exception. But as I said earlier, we want getAverage to pass along the exception to the caller. So we need to tell Java that that could happen.
