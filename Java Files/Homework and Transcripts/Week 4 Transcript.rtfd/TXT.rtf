\b \cf0 First, go into Eclipse and make a new Java project. It doesn't matter what you call it; you can use the default settings. Then within that project, make a new class. Again you can make the name whatever you want; for now, call it FirstDrawing so you match my code. But don't click Finish yet!

\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 To make graphics in Java, we're going to build off of classes that already exist in Java. These preexisting classes we'll be building from take care of the hard work of interpreting the instructions we will give so that no matter what hardware our program meets, the hardware will understand what we want it to do (as long as the hardware has a Java Virtual Machine installed and running.) We won't need to completely rewrite their code, but we do want to alter some of it so it draws the pictures we want. (The parts we'll be rewriting exist precisely to be overwritten as needed. If we don't write anything for them, their contents are empty by default and they won't do anything.)

\b \cf0 You may have done work with superclasses and, more generally, \cf3 inheritance\cf0  in previous programming courses. If not, or you don't quite remember how it works, don't worry. We'll go over it all in more detail later in the course. For now, you can just follow the steps and let Java take care of it for you.

\b \cf0 Anyway, the specific superclass we'll use here is \cf3 javax.swing.JPanel\cf0 . You can type that directly in the "Superclass:" field. You can also get to it by clicking the "Browse..." button next to the field, and then entering javax.swing.JPanel in the "Choose a type:" field. The advantage of the latter is that Eclipse shows you a list of the classes you might want to use as you type.

\b \cf0 "So what is a JPanel?" you will naturally be wondering. A JPanel provides an area where we can draw a picture. You can think of it as a canvas we can put paint on. For this program, we'll revise what is painted so it shows the graphics we want to display.

\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:36:08 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 The word \cf3 extends\cf0  is the Java keyword that tells the compiler that we are using JPanel as a superclass. Note that if you created your new class by typing the whole thing yourself, or if you forgot to set the superclass in Eclipse, you can just add the import and the words "extends JPanel" in the header of the class directly.

\b0 \cf0  
\fs20 7:36:28 pm
\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 As an aside, note that another way we could have gotten to this same point is that we could have just created FirstDrawing as a new class the way we've always been doing and then simply type in \cf3 extends JPanel\cf0  and put in the necessary import statement. I point this out so you understand that if you forget to tell Eclipse ahead of time that you want your class to inherit from some other class, you're free to type it in yourself later. The Eclipse feature we used where we typed JPanel into the "Superclass:" field was a convenience, not a logical necessity.

\b \cf0 By the way, the yellow line under FirstDrawing indicates a warning that we can ignore. It's too complicated to explain what the issue is, and it is unimportant for what we're doing. If it really bothers you, you can put the cursor over the yellow line and choose any of the "quick fixes".

\b \cf0 We're going to be using several JFrame methods over the next few lines. As usual, to call them, we give the name of the object followed by a dot followed by the method name. From this method's unusually long name, you can tell that it is used to determine what happens when we click the exit button on the window.

\b \cf0 The parameter we passed to the method is technically an integer. The allowed integers are defined in the JFrame class as static fields. We're using EXIT_ON_CLOSE which causes the application to end. There's also DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE or HIDE_ON_CLOSE or DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE (which kills the current window; this last one is useful if you have multiple windows in the same application).

\b \cf0 If you've seen coordinate systems in other math classes, you may be used to the origin being at the center (or lower-left, depending on what you're doing). We use the upper-left corner in graphics because that point doesn't depend on the size of the window. Also with old-time monitors, the computer would begin drawing by "lighting up" the pixel at the upper-left.
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf2 dkneezel
\b0 \cf0

\fs26 \
\pard\pardeftab720

\b \cf0 Another difference you may have seen is that, in graphics, the y-coordinates increase as you go down, as opposed to increasing as you move up. This is done to keep the coordinates of what we draw on screen positive. It's also another throwback to old monitors. Once the computer activated the upper-left, it proceeded by activating pixels from left to right and top to bottom.

\b \cf0 Java doesn't know what variable lines is within paintComponent. The variable is now in the scope of main only, so it only exists within main.

\b \cf0 The original bottom-right is the new bottom-left. So its x-coordinate is the same as the upper-left. We go 10 over to the original x and then the width of rectangle 2. That's 10+100=110.

\b \cf0 To find the y-coordinate, we can go up from the bottom by the height of the new rectangle. The bottom is at the original y (60) plus the original height (100) plus the height after the first rotate (30). We go up by subtracting the 100 for the original height, giving a final total of 90.

\b \cf0 In this case, though, instead of drawing the rectangle, Java draws the largest ellipse possible that will fit inside the rectangle. So, for my example, the oval does not actually touch (10, 60); that point is just above and to the left of the shape. Can you tell me the coordinates of the northernmost point on this ellipse?

\b \cf0 The first four parameters are the same as drawOval. We specify the upper-left corner, width, and height of the bounding rectangle. In the examples I showed you, I shifted the upper-left corner to the right of the oval, and I used the same size rectangle.

\b \cf0 The last two parameters to drawArc specify the part of the oval you wish to draw. We do it using angles. If we go due east (i.e. directly to the right), that's an angle of zero degrees. As you increase the angle, you go counterclockwise. So a 45-degree angle points directly northeast. A 90-degree angle points straight up. Straight down would be\'85?

\b \cf0 The final parameters to drawArc give the starting angle and how many degrees you want to go from there. In my example, we start at 0, and we go 90 degrees, so we're drawing the northeast quadrant of the oval.

\b \cf0 Java, as you may expect, has a class for color that, as you probably won't be surprised to learn, is called Color. Like Graphics, it's part of the java.awt package.

\b \cf0 There are two ways to make colors. The Color class comes with thirteen pre-defined colors including BLACK, BLUE, CYAN, DARK_GRAY, GRAY, GREEN, LIGHT_GRAY, MAGENTA, ORANGE, PINK, RED, WHITE, and YELLOW. To use them, you precede the name with Color. as in Color.BLUE.

\b \cf0 red, green, and blue should be replaced with integers between 0 and 255 inclusive. They represent the amount of that color to be added to the blend. 0 means none, and 255 means the maximum. Think of it as having red, green, and blue lamps connected to dimmer switches.
